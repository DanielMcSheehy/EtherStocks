This is a game; the rules are simple, try and make money buying and selling “stocks”. You can do this in a couple ways, you can simply buy low, sell high, or you can hodl and collect dividends.

Architecture: 
This game runs on dapp smart contracts such as: https://etherscan.io/address/0xa6230691b2b1cff2f9737ccfa3ff95d580e482a0
Each stock is its own smart contract, that allows buying/selling of erc20 'stock shares'.
The site itself only interacts with the contracts, so players do not have to worry about site security/crashing, which is the intended application of dapps. 
The day trader contracts are similar to the stocks, but have a 'game aspect' (see below), but invest the collected fees into the stocks (further incouraging stock investments). 

In order to use this website, your browser needs to have the browser extension MetaMask installed. After that, you will see numerous stocks available for purchase in the table below.

There are multiple actions that you can do with each stock:

1. Buy - Purchase shares at the current buy rate.

2. Sell - Sell your shares at the current sell rate - ETH will be deposited into your dividens.

3. Withdraw - Withdraw your dividends into your Ethereum network.

4. Reinvest - Purchase shares using ETH using your dividends for the current stock.

5. Get out - Sell your shares and withdraw dividends immediately.

Each time a share is purchased, the rate for subsequent purchaes will be increased by 0.25%.

Additionally, each time a share is bought or sold, 10% from the transaction will be distrubuted between all shareholders as a dividend.

Day Trader: 

Buying a day trader stocks allows you to be the temperary owner. Someone else can purchase the stock from you for 1.5X, or 2.0X the price (so you take away profit minus small fees). After 24 hours if no one buys a stock, the price resets. There will eventually be prices to be the last stock holder.
